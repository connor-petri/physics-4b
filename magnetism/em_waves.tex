\subsection{Electromagnetic Waves}
\hrulefill

\paragraph*{Definition}
Electromagnetic waves are waves of electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. They are generated by accelerating charges 
and are characterized by their frequency and wavelength. Electromagnetic waves are governed by Maxwell's equations, which describe how electric
and magnetic fields interact with each other.

\paragraph*{Maxwell's Equations}

\begin{align*}
    \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} &= \frac{Q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0} &\text{Gauss's Law}\\
    \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} &= 0 &\text{Gauss's Law in Magnetism}\\
    \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{\ell} &= -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} &\text{Faraday's Law}\\
    \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{\ell} &= \mu_0 I + \varepsilon_0\mu_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} &\text{Ampere-Maxwell Law}
\end{align*}

Where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field in volts per meter, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field in teslas, $d\vec{A}$ is an infinitesimal 
segment of the circuit in meters, $Q_{enc}$ is the charge enclosed by the loop in coulombs, $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free 
space in farads per meter, $d\vec{\ell}$ represents an infinitesimal segment of the wire's length, $\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux in webers, 
$\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space in henries per meter, $I$ is the current in amperes, and $\Phi_E$ is the electric flux in webers.\\

Note that if there is no current, $\mu_0 I = 0$, and the Ampere-Maxwell Law simplifies to:
\begin{align*}
    \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{\ell} &= \varepsilon_0\mu_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Electromagnetic Wave Equation}
The electromagnetic wave equation is a second-order partial differential equation that describes how electromagnetic waves propagate through space.

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial^2\vec{E}}{\partial x^2} &= \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial^2\vec{E}}{\partial t^2}\\
    \frac{\partial^2\vec{B}}{\partial x^2} &= \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial^2\vec{B}}{\partial t^2}\\
\end{align*}
    
Where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field in volts per meter, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field in teslas, $x$ is the position in meters, $t$ is the time 
in seconds, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space in henries per meter, and $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space in farads per meter.\\

\paragraph{The Speed of Light}
The speed of light is the speed at which electromagnetic waves propagate through space. It is given by the following equation.

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} &= \frac{1}{v}(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2})\\
    c &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}
\end{align*}

Where $y$ is the wave function, $x$ is the position in meters, $t$ is the time in seconds, $v$ is the velocity of the wave in meters per second,
and $c$ is the speed of light in meters per second.\\

\paragraph*{Solutions to the Wave Equation}
The general solution to the wave equation is a sinusoidal wave. The wave function is given by the following equation.
