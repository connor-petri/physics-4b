\subsection{Electric Fields}
\hrulefill

\paragraph*{Definition}
The electric field is a vector field that describes the force experienced by a charge at any point in space. 
It is measured in Newtons per Coulomb $[\frac{N}{C}]$. It is given by the equation:

\begin{equation*}
    \vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}_e}{q} \Longrightarrow \vec E = k_e \frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}
\end{equation*}

Where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field in Newtons per Coulomb, $\vec{F}_e$ is the electrostatic force experienced by the
particle in Newtons, and $q$ is the charge of the particle in Coulombs.\\
