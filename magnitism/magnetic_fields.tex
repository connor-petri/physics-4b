\subsection{Magnetic Fields}
\hrulefill

\paragraph*{Definition}
    A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, 
electric currents, and magnetic materials. They are generated by moving charges, or current. 
It is represented by the symbol $\vec{B}$ and is measured in teslas (T).\\

    Unlike electric fields, which can be generated by a single source charge, magnetic poles always come in pairs. 
There are no magnetic monopoles. The two types of magnetic poles are called north and south.

\begin{equation*}
    \vec{F}_B = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}
\end{equation*}

    Where $\vec{F}_B$ is the magnetic force in newtons, $q$ is the charge in coulombs, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity
of the charge in meters per second, and $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field in teslas. [Insert right hand rule stuff]
